*Delightful Home Drawable* is an implementation of a home-to-back-arrow icon presented in [Material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/delightful-details.html) (apologies for potato quality):

To use it, simply copy-paste/download the
[DelightfulHomeDrawable.java](https://github.com/tslamic/DelightfulMenuDrawable/blob/master/app/src/main/java/tslamic/github/com/delightfulmenudrawable/DelightfulMenuDrawable.java)
file. If enough people find it useful, I'll put it on Maven Central for easier access.

I've written a
[detailed blog post](http://tslamic.github.io/android-menu-icon/) about the implementation, in case you're curious.
